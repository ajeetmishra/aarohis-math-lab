# 🚀 Aarohi's Math Lab: The Olympiad Blueprint

Welcome to **Aarohi's Math Lab**, a suite of lightweight, interactive web applications designed to transform primary school mathematics from rote memorization into deep "Number Sense." 

Inspired by a 10-year-old's journey through robotics, tailoring, and competitive math, these tools are built to bridge the gap between classroom basics and Olympiad-level strategic thinking.

## 📖 For Parents & Teachers

### **The "Down Arrow" Philosophy**
Unlike standard quizzes that just tell a child if they are "Right" or "Wrong," this lab uses a **Three-Step Reveal** to build mental scaffolding:
1.  **The Challenge:** A problem is presented (e.g., $99 \times 11$).
2.  **The "Think" Bridge:** A logic hint appears to guide the mental process (e.g., "Think: $100 \times 10$").
3.  **The Result:** The actual answer is revealed alongside the estimate to build confidence.

### **The Labs**
* **⚡ Fast-Track Math:** Instant translation between percentages, fractions, and decimals.
* **📐 Robotics Compass:** Visualizing angles as "servo movements" and exploring the Perimeter-Area Paradox.
* **🔢 Number Hunter:** Mastering the "atoms" of math—Primes, Factors, HCF, and LCM.
* **🧠 Estimation Station:** Training the brain to find "friendly numbers" for lightning-fast guesses.
* **🍕 Fraction Lab:** A visual approach to the four core operations of fractions.
* **🧵 Tailor's Measure:** Connecting math to real-world design through unit and currency conversions.
* **✖️ Multiplication Pro:** Mastering tables, squares, and cubes with a focus on "instant recall".

## 🛠️ How to Use

### **For Students**
* **Keyboard:** Use the **Down Arrow (↓)** to reveal the logic bridge and the answer.
* **Tablet/Touch:** Tap the big **"Next Step ➔"** button at the bottom of the screen or tap the card itself.
* **Goal Tracking:** Click **"View Session History"** in the sidebar to see how many questions you've mastered in one go!

### **For Parents**
* **Customization:** Use the sidebar to adjust the difficulty. You can set specific number ranges (e.g., only practice 7s and 8s) or enable "Master Primes" ($1/7$, $1/11$) for an extra challenge.
* **Progress Checks:** The session history log is stored locally in your browser for the current session, allowing you to review the "Question vs Answer" list before closing the app.

## 💻 For Technical Users

### **Architecture**
This project is a **"Static Web Suite."** It requires no database, no backend, and no complicated setup.
* **Stack:** Pure HTML5, CSS3 (with Responsive Design), and Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Responsiveness:** Includes a "Mobile-First" override that hides settings behind a hamburger menu on smaller screens, maximizing focus on the problem.
* **Hosting:** Optimized for **GitHub Pages**. Simply upload the files to a repository and enable "Pages" in the settings to get your live URL.

### **Installation**
1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aarohis-math-lab.git`
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3.  To host it yourself, simply drag and drop the files into a GitHub repository and turn on GitHub Pages.
